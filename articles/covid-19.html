      Further to the ECB advice received on Wednesday 18th March, all Bar Hill Cricket Club activities are suspended until further notice.<br/><br/>

      We are very sorry to have to make this decision, but I’m sure you all agree that we must as a club and as individuals play our part in the collective responsibilities we are facing as a nation. In short, our health and the health of those around us must come first.<br/><br/>

      In the immediate future, this means there will be no more net sessions at Fenner’s on Sunday evenings. The Cricket Force event (tidying up our containers) on Saturday March 28th will not now happen and the fundraising quiz night at the social club on Saturday April 18th will be postponed to a later date.<br/><br/>

      We had planned to start youth training sessions on Wednesday April 22nd and our first matches were due to be played in early May in both youth and adult sections. As things stand, all of those are cancelled.<br/><br/>

      The ECB has not placed an end date on the suspension and we therefore cannot say when, or if, we will be able to play this season. We will keep you informed and hope that we will be able to play at some point in the summer.<br/><br/>

      No membership fees will be payable until we know whether or not we will be able to play this season and the committee will review the level of membership and match fees once we have a date when we can resume playing.<br/><br/>

      Most importantly, stay safe and well in these difficult times and if we can help any of you in any way, then please ask. We have a club Facebook group, so let’s use it to check in with each other while we may not be able to do so in person!<br/><br/>
