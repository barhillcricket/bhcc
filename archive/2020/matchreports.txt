Team A set a decent score of 104-6, with <strong>Adam Dean</strong> scoring 38 in his only innings. Team B began slowly but eventually got going with <strong>Nathan Dean</strong> scoring a quick 25 before being bowled by his brother. <strong>Tom Levitt</strong> also scored 20 on his return to the club. Tight bowling at the end meant Team A won by 6 runs with <strong>Tom Page</strong> taking 5 wickets in his 6 overs and <strong>Adam Dean</strong> taking 4 in his 3 overs."

    "report": "The first league match of the season took place 351 days after the last match of the previous season and began with a quick start for Bar Hill, who lost the toss and were put into bat, with <strong>Jim Neal (52)</strong> and <strong>Paul Stimpson (19)</strong>. Bar Hill faultered and ended on 113 all out, after only batting for 32 overs. The strong bowling attack showed, however, as <strong>Scott Underhay (2)</strong>, <strong>Phil Orvis (3)</strong>, <strong>Tom Page (2)</strong>, and <strong>Adam Dean (2)</strong> each took multiple wickets at regular intervals and knocked Longstowe over for just 45."

    "report": "League cricket returned to Bar Hill for our first home match. We lost the toss and were put into the field on a warm August afternoon. Bar Hill did well to take wickets regularly and were able to restrict a strong looking Cam Kerala team to just 98. <strong>Sam Wilson</strong> put in an outstanding bowling performance taking 6 wickets for 12 runs, including a hat-trick (the first for the club in 11 years). A mix of good bowling and difficult batting conditions led to a collapse for Bar Hill in what was, at times, a heated competition with the opposition. <strong>James Barclay</strong> top scored with 13, but Bar Hill fell for just 55 runs and lost the match."

    "report": "On a blustery day, Cambourne won the toss and surprisingly elected to bat. Bar Hill struggled to take wickets against a solid batting line-up. Eventually wickets started to fall, with <strong>Phil Orvis</strong> the pick of the bowlers with 2-8, and we restricted Cambourne to 118 all out. Cambourne's excellent bowling proved too much for Bar Hill's batting with the top scores being <strong>Peter Stockton</strong> and <strong>Tom Page</strong> with just 11 each. Bar Hill were bowled out for 64 runs."
