    "report": "Bar Hill won the toss and elected to field on the first warm day of the season. Cam Kerala got off to a quick start before their number three scored an impressive 150 before being caught late on. Some impressive fielding enabled three run outs and a catch but left only <strong>Phil Orvis</strong> (2-28) and <strong>Barry Driver</strong> (2-57) as the only bowlers to take wickets. In reply Bar Hill struggled, with only the two openers making it into double figures, and scored only 68 all out."

    "report": "For the first time in several years Bar Hill had two teams playing a match on the same day. Cambourne won the toss and elected to bat and managed to put on a modest total of 195 after having put together a couple of large partnerships. Wickets were shared arount with <strong>James Barclay</strong> (1-12) the pick of the bowlers. In reply Bar Hill were always behind the run rate and had several players who made good starts but could not go on including <strong>James Barclay</strong> (23) and <strong>Jim Neal</strong> (19) as well as a late flurry from <strong>Adam Dean</strong> (17*) which was too late to affect the outcome of the match."

    "report": "The second team's first home game started with Bar Hill winning the toss and electing to field. A real lack of wickets cost the team massively as Cambourne scored 192-3 from their 40 overs. <strong>Jamil Haque</strong> (1-20) was the standout bowling performance. The run chase started poorly with both openers out for a duck and ending the first over 0-2. Only our additional player and <strong>Jamil Haque</strong> (19) managed to score a decent amount of runs before falling to 51 all out in just 23.3 overs."
